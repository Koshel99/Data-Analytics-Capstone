# ABC Bank Analysis - Capstone Project

## Project Overview
For my final capstone project, I analyzed an ABC Bank dataset using Python to explore the following aspects:

- **Characteristics of Customers Who Left**: Identifying patterns and factors leading to customer churn.
- **Hypothesis on Reasons for Churn**: Exploring potential reasons behind why customers decided to leave.
- **Strategic Solutions**: Recommendations based on the data findings.
- **Predictive Model**: A Python-based predictive model to forecast future churn.
